This is a game of TicTacToe. It has three different ways of playing. First, it allows two users to play against eachother, like a normal game with paper. Next, it allows one user to play against an easy AI bot. The easy AI places its "O" at random. The third and last way of playing is against the hard AI bot. The hard AI will see where you place your "X". It will calculate the best move for it to play, whether that be making the winning move, or blocking the player from winning.
